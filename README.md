# Biosignal-Activity
Human activity recognition using various biosignals 

This is the final course project for the data science boot camp (Spring 2024 cohort) from Erdos Institute (https://www.erdosinstitute.org/).
The goal is to use machine learning models to recognize human activities from a collection of various time series biosignals (like ECG, EDA, ACC, etc).
